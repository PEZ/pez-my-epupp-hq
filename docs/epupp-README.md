# Epupp: Live Tamper your Web

A web browser extension that lets you tamper with web pages, live and/or with userscripts.

</div>

Epupp has two modes of operation:

1. **Live REPL connection from your editor to the web page**, letting you inspect and modify the page on the fly, with or without the assistance of an AI agent.
2. **Userscripts**: [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net) style. Target all websites, or any subset of the web's pages, with prepared scripts that modify or query information from the page. Userscripts can be configured to start before the page loads (`document-start`), through the early loader (`document-end` - wait explicitly if your script needs DOM-ready behavior), or after everything has settled (`document-idle`).

The two form a powerful pair. The live REPL connection, while happily supporting one-off changes or data extractions, is also a very efficient and fun means to interactively develop userscripts.

> [!NOTE]
> To make this easier to get started with, and using, I have created a template project with some configuration and instructions for humans and AIs:
> * https://github.com/PEZ/my-epupp-hq
>
> But please read this below first.

## Example Epupp Use Cases

**Custom Data Dashboards**:
* **Problem**: Some web page you often visit keeps updated data, but doesn't present it aggregated the way you want it.
* **Solution**: A userscript automatically aggregates the data the way you want it and presents it the way you want it, every time you visit the page.

**One-off Data Extraction**:
* **Problem**: Some web page you visit one time has information you want to summarize (or just find).
* **Solution**: Connect your editor and/or AI agent and poke around the DOM of the web page until you understand enough to create a function that collects the data you need.

**Print-friendly Pages**:
* **Problem**: Some web page you visit is hard to print cleanly on your printer.
* **Solution**: Connect your editor and/or AI agent and poke around the DOM of the web page until you understand enough to create a function that isolates only the part you want to print. (This was the use case that made me create Epupp in the first place.) This can be generalized in a userscript that lets you use your mouse to point at the element you want to isolate on any web page.

**Missing UI Controls**:
* **Problem**: Some web app you often use lacks a button or input widget that would make your workflow convenient.
* **Solution**: A userscript automatically adds the buttons and widgets for you every time you use the app.

**AI-powered Web Inspection**:
* **Problem**: You want to show your AI agent some web app, in a way that it can read things and inspect whatever aspect of it you are interested in.
* **Solution**: Give the agent access to the page using the live REPL connection.

**AI-assisted Web Development**:
* **Problem**: You want your AI agent to help you with a page/app you are developing.
* **Solution**: Give the agent access to the page using the live REPL connection. While you and the agent are updating the page, the agent always has instant access to the DOM, styles, and everything to gather feedback on the changes. It can test that the app works as it should, and fulfill development tasks with much less help from you in manual testing.

When it comes to userscript use cases, a lot of things that you would use Tampermonkey for, you can use Epupp for instead. Tampermonkey can probably handle more use cases, but Epupp lets you develop userscripts in a much more dynamic way, with the shortest possible feedback loop.

With the live REPL connection, you will discover use cases you may not ever have thought about before, or thought about, but dismissed.

## Get Started

### Install

#### Chrome

1. Install from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/bfcbpnmgefiblppimmoncoflmcejdbei).
2. Pin Epupp to the toolbar so it is always visible.
3. Navigate away from the extension store - these pages can't be scripted.

I also recommend allowing Epupp in Private Browsing for maximum utility. The extension does not collect any data whatsoever.

#### Firefox

1. Install from [Firefox Browser Addons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/epupp/).
2. Pin the Epupp icon to the toolbar - this is important for seeing permission badges.
3. Navigate away from the addon store.

Firefox treats host permissions as optional, so Epupp starts without permission to auto-run scripts on pages. When you visit a page that matches an auto-run script, Epupp shows a "!" badge on the extension icon. Click the icon and grant permission from the banner that appears. After granting, scripts auto-run as expected.

You can also grant broad permission via **about:addons** -> **Epupp** -> **Permissions** -> toggle "Access your data for all websites".

> [!NOTE]
> Epupp has some quirks in Firefox, so not fully at par with how it works in Chrome. Please search and/or file issues for things you note not working.

#### Safari

I'm still pondering wether I should submit to Safari App Store. Apple doesn't exactly love developers... But you can still use Epupp with Safari:

Grab the extension zip file(s) from the Epupp repository, latest [release](https://github.com/PEZ/epupp/releases). In the case of Safari, download `epupp-safari.zip`. Then in Safari:
1. Open **Settings** -> **Developer**
2. Click **Add Temporary Extension...**

Please note that I haven't yet figured out all Safari nuances, so some things may not work. Please file issues for things you note not working.

### Userscript: Hello World

Create a userscript and run it in some different ways:

1. Open the Developers Tools panel in your browser
2. Select the **Epupp** tab
3. Last in the script text area, add a new line and enter:
   ```clojure
   (js/alert "Hello World!")
   ```
4. Click **Eval Script** to see the alert happen (and the browser console will print things too, assuming you kept the default script.)
5. Save the script using the **Save Script** button.
6. Open the Epupp popup by clicking the Eppup extension in the browser toolbar. You will see the script there, named `hello_world.cljs`.
7. Click the `Play` button on the script. The alert shows again.
8. Reload the page. The alert show again. The default example code includes a script manifest that will make the script trigger on domain you are currently visiting.
9. Navigate to another domain and the alert will not show. Navigate back to the previous domain,  and the alert shows.
10. Annoyed by the alert? Either delete the script or edit it to not alert. The Epupp popup lets you both delete the script and load it in the panel for editing.

### REPL: Hello World

While the Epupp panel let's you script the page, Live Tampering comes to life when you are powered by your favorite development environment, which could be a code editor, an AI agent harness, or both. As the creator of [Calva](https://calva.io) I choose to describe how it can be done using [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) + Calva, and with [VS Code Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) and [Calva Backseat Driver](https://github.com/BetterThanTomorrow/calva-backseat-driver). Please see [connecting-to-epupp](docs/connecting-to-epupp.md) README for info about connecting editors and AIs.

0. Install [Babashka](https://babashka.org) and VS Code. In VS Code, install the Calva extension
1. On a GitHub page (this one will do fine), open the Epupp popup and, copy the browser-nrepl command line, using the default ports
1. Paste the command line in a terminal and run it
1. From the Epupp popup, click **Connect**
1. In VS Code create a file `hello_world.cljs`
1. Click the REPL button in the VS Code status bar and select **Connect to a running REPL in your project**
1. Select **scittle** from the Project Types menu
1. In the file, type:
   ```clojure
   (js/alert "Hello World!")
   ```
   And press <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> <br>
   (The <kbd>alt</kbd> key is sometimes labeled <kbd>opt</kbd> or <kbd>option</kbd>.)
1. Replace the contents of the file with:
   ```clojure
     ;; Make the GitHub logo spin!
     (when-let [logo (js/document.querySelector ".octicon-mark-github")]
       (set! (.. logo -style -animation) "spin 2s linear infinite")
       ;; Add the keyframes for spinning
       (let [style (js/document.createElement "style")]
         (set! (.-textContent style)
               "@keyframes spin { from { transform: rotate(0deg); } to { transform: rotate(360deg); } }")
         (.appendChild js/document.head style)))
   ```
   Press <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd>. The GitHub icon should start spinning.

Note: The <kbd>alt</kbd>+<kbd>enter</kbd> shortcut evaluates the current top level form/expression, which in the above cases happen to be everything in the file. If you are new to Clojure, for now you can think about it as executing the code in the connected browser tab. Please visit [calva.io](https://calva.io) for how to use and get started with Calva (and Clojure).

### AI Agent: Hello World

As the creator of Calva, and Calva Backseat Driver I chose to desceibe how to connect an AI agent using VS Code, Copilot and Calva Backseat Driver. See https://github.com/PEZ/my-epupp-hq for a growing list of instructions for other AI harnesses.

0. In addition to the above, install Copilot and Calva Backseat Driver to VS Code.
1. Ask Copilot to try the Epupp REPL to do something fun.

> [!NOTE]
> Copilot will need to know some basics about Epupp to be really effective with it. Consider copying the https://github.com/PEZ/my-epupp-hq template project and use that as a start for you and your AI to explore the Epupp REPL with.


### Install a userscript

An Epupp userscript is just a text file which starts with a script manifest and some code. You can install scripts in three ways:

1. Pasting/typing a script in the Epupp panel and clicking **Save Script**.
2. The **Web Userscript Installer** script. The extension has a built-in script that identifies Epupp scripts on code-hosting pages and adds an **Install** button near them. On GitHub gist pages and GitHub repo file pages, installable code blocks that declare `:epupp/library? true` can also show **Copy library URL**, which copies a pinned dependency URL you can paste into `:epupp/inject`. On whitelisted domains (GitHub, GitHub Gists, GitLab, Codeberg, localhost) it can install scripts into Epupp. On other sites, it shows copy-paste instructions instead. Try it on this gist: https://gist.github.com/PEZ/3b0fdc406e7593eaaef609b6fb4a687d (It's the script created in the demo video.)
3. Using the REPL. There's a `epupp.fs` namespace for listing/reading/writing/renaming scripts in the Epupp extension storage.

## The Epupp UI

The UI has three main components:

1. The extension **popup**. You access this from the Epupp extension icon. The popup hosts the REPL connection UI, lists userscripts, and provides accesss to Epupp settings.
2. A browser Developement Tools **panel**. The panel is for inspecting and editing userscripts, creating simple usercripts, and for dynamic interaction with the visited web page.
3. Your favorite **editor** and/or your favorite **AI agent** harness. This is enabled by the live REPL connection.

### Popup

The popup has the following sections:

1. **REPL Connect**. Shows how to connect the current tab's REPL to your editor and/or AI agent. Also shows which tabs are currently connected.
2. Userscripts sections:
   * **Manual/on-demand**. Scripts that do not auto-run on any page, use the **play** button to run them.
  * **Libraries**. Scripts marked with `:epupp/library? true` that have no auto-run pattern. These are explicitly marked library scripts used by other scripts via `:epupp/inject`. Collapsed by default. Other scripts can still participate in dependency flows via `:epupp/inject`.
   * **Auto-run for this page**. Scripts that has an `:epupp/auto-run-match` pattern than matches the current page.
   * *Auto-run not matching this page*. Scripts that auto-runs on some other pages, but not the current one.
   * **Special**. Built-in scripts that has some special way of being triggered to start. (Currently only the **Web Userscript Installer**)
3. **Settings**. Open the **Settings** section in the popup.

#### Script Management

Use the eye icon to load a script into the panel editor. From there it's the usual loop: edit, save, test.

Rename by changing `:epupp/script-name` in the manifest and saving. Copying is the same trick: give `:epupp/script-name` a new name and save, and you get a new script.

Built-in scripts are readable but not editable in place. Inspect one, copy it, rename it, then make it yours.

#### Settings

**Default ports** (nREPL and WebSocket) are the ports shown in REPL Connect for sites that have not been given specific ports. If you edit the ports in REPL Connect to values that differ from the defaults, those ports become a per-site override and stick even when defaults change.

**Reconnect connected tabs on navigation** re-establishes the REPL connection when a connected tab navigates to a new page. REPL state is lost but the connection is restored. This setting is overridden when Auto-connect is active.

**Auto-connect** controls whether Epupp connects a REPL automatically:
- **Never** (default): no automatic connections.
- **On page load**: connect to every page you load.
- **On page load + tab activation**: connect to every page and follow your active tab.

**Allow REPL FS Sync for this tab** turns on `epupp.fs` for that tab. Enabling sync gives access to code on that tab to install userscripts. Only enable this on a page you trust. See [REPL FS Sync](docs/repl-fs-sync.md) for the API.

**Diagnostics logging** adds noisy logs for when things are weird.

**Export / Import** is for backups and moving scripts between browser profiles or machines. It does not include general extension settings.

### Panel

The Browser Development Tools panel you can create and experiment with userscripts.

**New** clears the editor, with a safety prompt if you have unsaved changes. **Save Script** stores the script, as long as it starts with a valid manifest map.

Use **Eval Script** to run the whole editor buffer. `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` / `Cmd+Enter` runs selection if you have one, otherwise the whole script. This is the fastest feedback loop in Epupp (without editor connection): define a helper, select just the call, press `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter`, inspect the result, repeat.

Results show up below the script textarea - both what ran and what came back (or the error). Use **Clear** when you want a clean slate.

### REPL

The REPL connection is there so that you can connect your code editor and/or AI agent harness to Epupp and live tamper the connected tabs. The system has these components:

* The Epupp **REPL** (a program running in the browser that can evaluate/execute Epupp/Scittle code in the connected tab's environment). The Epupp REPL listens to messages over a WebSocket.
* The **browser-nrepl** relay. This is a program you run on your computer that relays between the **REPL client** (using the nREPL protocol) and the connected browser tab (the WebSocket).
* The **REPL client**. Really the **nREPL** client. A program connecting software such as editors and AI agent harnesses to an nREPL server (the browser-nrepl relay, in this case). In the [REPL: Hello World](#repl-hello-world) example above the nREPL Client is Calva.

The procedure to connect a browser tab to your editor is:

1. **Start the browser-nrepl relay** (you can copy the command from the Epupp extension popup)
2. **Connect the browser tab**: Click **Connect** in the Epupp popup
3. **Connect your editor/AI harness**: This will depend on what editor/harness you use. _TL;DR_: You need a Clojure plugin/extension for your coding editor, and/or some Clojure hook or MCP server for your AI agent. (See above for using VS Code and Calva.)

See https://github.com/PEZ/my-epupp-hq for a template project that you can use to keep the Epupp REPL in easy reach.

The popup shows currently connected tabs in the REPL section. Each one gets a **Reveal** button so you can jump straight to connected tabs. The toolbar icon mirrors connection status of the current tab: white when it's not connected, gold when it is.

You can keep multiple tabs connected at once. Run multiple `browser-nrepl` relays (different port pairs), then point each tab at the relay you want. Handy when you want GitHub and GitLab live at the same time.

## The Anatomy of a Userscript

An Epupp userscript starts with a manifest map, followed by ClojureScript code:

```clojure
{:epupp/script-name "github_tweaks.cljs"
 :epupp/auto-run-match "https://github.com/*"
 :epupp/description "Make the GitHub logo spin"
 :epupp/run-at "document-idle"
 :epupp/inject ["scittle://replicant.js"]}

(ns github-tweaks)

(when-let [logo (js/document.querySelector ".octicon-mark-github")]
  (let [style (js/document.createElement "style")]
    (set! (.-textContent style)
          "@keyframes spin { from { transform: rotate(0deg); } to { transform: rotate(360deg); } }")
    (.appendChild js/document.head style))
  (set! (.. logo -style -animation) "spin 2s linear infinite"))
```

The manifest is a plain Clojure map at the top of the file. Your code runs in the page context with full DOM and JavaScript environment access.

### Manifest Keys

| Key | Required | Default | Description |
|-----|----------|---------|-------------|
| `:epupp/script-name` | Yes | - | Filename or Clojure namespace, auto-normalized to a path. Dots become `/`, spaces/dashes become `_` (e.g. `pez.my-script` becomes `pez/my_script.cljs`). Cannot start with `epupp/` (reserved). |
| `:epupp/auto-run-match` | No | - | URL glob pattern(s). String or vector of strings. Omit for manual-only scripts. |
| `:epupp/description` | No | - | Shown in the popup UI. |
| `:epupp/run-at` | No | `"document-idle"` | When to run: `"document-start"`, `"document-end"`, or `"document-idle"`. |
| `:epupp/inject` | No | `[]` | Dependency URLs to load before the script runs. Supports `scittle://` (bundled libraries), `epupp://` (user library scripts), and raw HTTPS URLs from `raw.githubusercontent.com` or `gist.githubusercontent.com` pinned to full SHAs. |
| `:epupp/library?` | No | `false` | Mark as a library script. Library-only scripts (no `:epupp/auto-run-match`) appear in a dedicated Libraries section in the popup. Scripts with both `:epupp/library?` and `:epupp/auto-run-match` appear in their auto-run section. |

Scripts with `:epupp/auto-run-match` start disabled. Enable them in the popup for auto-injection on matching pages. Scripts without this key only run when you click the Play button in the popup.

Script names are auto-normalized to valid ClojureScript file paths. Dots become `/` (supporting Clojure namespace conventions), spaces and dashes become `_`, and all other non-alphanumeric characters are stripped. Examples: `"My Script"` becomes `my_script.cljs`, `"pez.linkedin-squirrel"` becomes `pez/linkedin_squirrel.cljs`.

Scripts can also be managed programmatically via the [FS API](docs/repl-fs-sync.md).

### URL Patterns

`:epupp/auto-run-match` uses glob syntax. `*` matches any characters:

```clojure
;; Single pattern
{:epupp/auto-run-match "https://github.com/*"}

;; Multiple patterns
{:epupp/auto-run-match ["https://github.com/*"
                        "https://gist.github.com/*"]}

;; Match both http and https
{:epupp/auto-run-match "*://example.com/*"}
```

### Script Timing

Scripts can run at different points during page load:

- `"document-idle"` (default) - After the page has fully loaded.
- `"document-end"` - Routed through the early loader at `document-start`. If your script needs DOM-ready behavior, wait explicitly.
- `"document-start"` - Before any page JavaScript. `document.body` does not exist yet.

If your script is using `document-start` or `document-end`, you need to wait for the DOM if your code needs it:

```clojure
{:epupp/script-name "early_intercept.cljs"
 :epupp/run-at "document-start"}

;; This runs before any page scripts
(set! js/window.myGlobal "intercepted")

;; Wait for DOM if needed
(js/document.addEventListener "DOMContentLoaded"
  (fn [] (js/console.log "Now DOM exists")))
```

> [!NOTE]
> Safari does not support early script timing. Scripts always run at `document-idle` regardless of `:epupp/run-at`.

### Using [Scittle](https://github.com/babashka/scittle) Libraries

Userscripts can load bundled Scittle ecosystem libraries via `:epupp/inject`:

```clojure
{:epupp/script-name "replicant_widget.cljs"
 :epupp/auto-run-match "*"
 :epupp/inject ["scittle://replicant.js"]}

(ns replicant-widget
  (:require [replicant.dom :as r]))

(r/render
 (doto (js/document.createElement "div")
   (->> (.appendChild js/document.body)))
 [:h1 "Hello from Replicant!"])
```

**Available libraries:**

| Require URL | Provides |
|-------------|----------|
| `scittle://pprint.js` | `cljs.pprint` |
| `scittle://promesa.js` | `promesa.core` |
| `scittle://replicant.js` | Replicant UI library |
| `scittle://js-interop.js` | `applied-science.js-interop` |
| `scittle://reagent.js` | [Reagent](https://reagent-project.github.io) + React |
| `scittle://re-frame.js` | [Re-frame](https://github.com/day8/re-frame) (includes Reagent) |
| `scittle://cljs-ajax.js` | `cljs-http.client` |

Dependencies resolve automatically: `scittle://re-frame.js` loads Reagent and React.

### Library Namespaces

Any userscript can serve as a shared library. Reference it from another script's `:epupp/inject` using the `epupp://` protocol:

**Library script** (`utils/dom.cljs`):
```clojure
{:epupp/script-name "utils/dom.cljs"
 :epupp/description "DOM utility functions"
 :epupp/library? true}

(ns utils.dom)

(defn hide! [selector]
  (when-let [el (js/document.querySelector selector)]
    (set! (.. el -style -display) "none")))
```

**Consumer script** (`my/tweaks.cljs`):
```clojure
{:epupp/script-name "my/tweaks.cljs"
 :epupp/auto-run-match "https://example.com/*"
 :epupp/inject ["scittle://replicant.js" "epupp://utils/dom.cljs"]}

(ns my.tweaks
  (:require [utils.dom :as dom]
            [replicant.dom :as r]))

(dom/hide! "#annoying-banner")
```

Epupp resolves dependencies transitively: if your library itself has `epupp://` or `scittle://` dependencies, those are resolved too. Cycles are detected and reported.

Any script becomes a library when another script references it via `:epupp/inject`. Disabled scripts and built-in scripts are valid library targets. Scripts can also declare `:epupp/library? true` in their manifest to appear in the popup's Libraries section (when they have no auto-run pattern).

> [!NOTE]
> When a script both auto-runs and is used as a library by another auto-run script on the same page, it may execute twice (once as a library injection, once as its own auto-run).

From a live REPL session, you can load libraries at runtime with `epupp.repl/manifest!`:

```clojure
(epupp.repl/manifest! {:epupp/inject ["scittle://pprint.js"
                                      "epupp://utils/dom.cljs"]})
(require '[cljs.pprint :as pprint])
(pprint/pprint {:some "data"})
```

Safe to call multiple times with the same dependency set.

### External Dependencies

Scripts can depend on code hosted on GitHub's raw content hosts via HTTPS URLs in `:epupp/inject`. Supported hosts are `raw.githubusercontent.com` for repository files and `gist.githubusercontent.com` for gists. All URLs must be pinned to a full 40-character SHA, ensuring immutable, reproducible dependencies.

```clojure
{:epupp/script-name "my/tweaks.cljs"
 :epupp/auto-run-match "https://example.com/*"
 :epupp/inject ["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef01234567/path/to/helpers.cljs"
                "https://gist.githubusercontent.com/user/GIST_ID/raw/89abcdef0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef/helpers.cljs"]}
```

**Trusted URL formats:**

| Host | Format |
|------|--------|
| `raw.githubusercontent.com` | `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/owner/repo/SHA/path/to/file.cljs` |
| `gist.githubusercontent.com` | `https://gist.githubusercontent.com/owner/GIST_ID/raw/SHA/filename.cljs` |

On GitHub gist pages and GitHub repo file pages, installable code blocks marked `:epupp/library? true` can show `Copy library URL` alongside Install or Update. It copies one of the pinned URL formats above. The copied value may be normalized or derived, so it is not necessarily the page's visible Raw link. This is a library-authoring convenience, not a requirement for participating in dependency flows.

External dependencies are fetched and cached when the script is saved (via panel, web installer, or FS API). At page load, they're injected from cache. Transitive dependencies are supported.

Only public GitHub content is supported (no authentication). Branch or tag references are not allowed - use a full commit SHA.

## Epupp Userscript Gallery

There is no Epupp Userscript Gallery yet. Epupp is brand new! But I have made two quite useful scripts that you can test and explore.

### Element Printing

Isolate elements on crowded web pages for printing. (It's the script created in the demo video.)

Install `pez/element_printing.cljs` from this gist: https://gist.github.com/PEZ/3b0fdc406e7593eaaef609b6fb4a687d

(This is the use case I created Epupp to solve, to begin with.)

### LinkedIn Squirrel

Ever been reading a post on LinkedIn, only for the feed to be refreshed and the post gone forever? Ever recalled that post you read earlier today, or yesterday, but can't find it when you want to show it to your friend? **LinkedIn Squirrel**, en Epupp userscript, to the rescue!

Install `pez/linkedin_squirrel.cljs` from this gist: https://gist.github.com/PEZ/d466a85f98ec3f5f2e9aea7a13b89007

LinkedIn Squirrel has two main features:

1. Lets you reinsert the posts you were seeing when the feed got refreshed
2. Hoards posts you engage with. Let's you access them from an always available list, which has filtering and instant search. _Engagement_ is that you post something, like, expand read “More...”, repost, and so on. You can also explicitly pin a post to hoard it.

## REPL Pitfalls

### Navigation Hangs the REPL

On non-SPA sites, setting `js/window.location` (or clicking a link) from a REPL eval can tear down the page and its REPL. The eval response never returns - the connection hangs until you reconnect the repl. Very disruptive!

**Fix: Defer navigation with `setTimeout`:**

```clojure
;; BAD - eval never completes, connection hangs
(set! (.-location js/window) "https://example.com/page")

;; GOOD - returns immediately, navigates after response completes
(js/setTimeout
  #(set! (.-location js/window) "https://example.com/page")
  50)
;; => timeout ID returned instantly
```

After navigation, wait for the new page to load and REPL to reconnect. All prior definitions will be gone - redefine utilities or bake them into a userscript.

### Clipboard Access Blocked

`navigator.clipboard.writeText` is often blocked, needing user gesture, due to permissions policy. Use a textarea workaround:

```clojure
(defn copy-to-clipboard! [text]
  (let [el (js/document.createElement "textarea")]
    (set! (.-value el) text)
    (.appendChild js/document.body el)
    (.select el)
    (js/document.execCommand "copy")
    (.removeChild js/document.body el)))
```

## Security

* Userscripts run with full page access, including all the dangerous things. The gate is the user, scrutinizing userscripts and userscript authors.
* Auto-run requires browser permission:
  * Chrome grants it automatically at install.
  * Firefox requires an explicit user grant. Epupp has UI for this.
  * Safari grants it per-website with some Safari-provided ways to control it.
* To expose its REPL, Epupp connects to a WebSocket port on localhost. The user is responsible for what program is listening on that port.
* On an allowlist of exact origins (`https://github.com`, `https://gist.github.com`, `https://gitlab.com`, `https://codeberg.org`, `http://localhost`, and `http://127.0.0.1`), page code can install and update userscripts. Page code can not, however, list or read userscripts from Epupp, even on these origins.
* When REPL FS Sync is enabled, any code can list, read, write, and delete userscripts. This access is disabled by default. It needs to be enabled every time a REPL connection has been established, and can only be enabled to one tab at a time. The user is responsible for ensuring that no extension, or page code, including userscripts, exploits this access.

## Troubleshooting

### No Epupp panel?

The extension fails at adding a Development Tools panel at any `chrome://` page, and also at the Extension Gallery itself. These are pages from where you may have installed Epupp the first time. Please navigate to other pages and look for the panel.

### Connection fails?

Check that the relay server is running and ports match between terminal and popup. If it still won't connect, try restarting the relay server.

### Script doesn't run?

1. Is auto-run enabled? (the checkbox in the popup)
2. Does the pattern match the URL? Check for typos.
3. Open DevTools console for error messages.

### CSP errors?

Some sites have strict Content Security Policies. Epupp mostly should do things in ways that are allowed by these oliciies, but still, check the console for CSP violation messages.

## Extension Permissions

Epupp only asks for the permissions it strictly needs, even if the nature of the extension is such that it needs you to permit things like scripting (duh!). These are the permissions, and for what they are used:

- `scripting` - Inject userscripts
- `<all_urls>` - Inject on any site
- `storage` - Persist scripts/settings
- `webNavigation` - Auto-injection on page load
- `activeTab` - DevTools panel integration

## Scittle

Epupp is powered by [Scittle](https://github.com/babashka/scittle), which allows for scripting the page using [ClojureScript](https://clojurescript.org), a dynamic language supporting **Interactive Programming**.

## Privacy

The extension does not collect any data whatsoever, and never will.
